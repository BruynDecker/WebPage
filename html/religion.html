        <h2>My Journey: Understanding Jesus Christ's Message in the Restoration</h2>
        <p>We have often been told that the Book of Mormon contains the "fullness of the gospel". I always thought, if that's really true, then why doesn't the Book of Mormon mention the temple or any of the temple ordinances at all?</p>
        <p>It seemed like Joseph Smith kind of did two things: first, he translated the Book of Mormon. Then he set it aside, started the Church, and years later introduced the full temple experience and all of the theology that comes with it.</p>
        <p>But I was wrong. A friend recommended a newer book to me, and it changed my perspective. In short: The Book of Mormon and the temple experience both teach the same doctrines. Each guides us through our journey in life, walking the strait and narrow path to approach Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon teaches this through words, and the temple teaches it through ritual. The core message—coming closer to Christ through covenant and revelation—is the same.</p>

        <h3 class="subheading">The Book: "In the Language of Adam"</h3>
        <p>I read "In the Language of Adam" via audiobook on Audible. D. John Butler is a good narrator, though I noticed a few repeated lines—likely a small editorial slip. It didn’t hinder my understanding, just made me think I'd hit the "back 10" button accidentally.</p>
        <p>The narration was otherwise professional: good pacing, consistent volume, and steady cadence. The downside of the audiobook format is the lack of immediate access to the numerous scripture references the book provides. Still, for my busy schedule—finishing school, heavy credit loads, and limited funds—listening while walking at night or doing dishes worked best for me.</p>

        <h3 class="subheading">Content Overview</h3>
        <p>The book starts by introducing its main idea, then delves into deeper analyses of specific stories. If you're already convinced of its core thesis, the introduction might feel slow, but it's essential groundwork.</p>

        <h3 class="subheading">Main Thesis</h3>
        <p>The main thesis is that during 1st temple Judaism, there was a religion that revolved around the family of God (most importantly, including his son Jehovah), the Melchizedek priesthood “visionary men”, and the temple “the course of the lord” (i.e. similar to what Margaret Barker says).</p>
        <p>Because the Book of Mormon (allegedly) dates to this time period, we should see reflections of this in the Book of Mormon.</p>
        <p>The way DJB finds this religion in the, at first glance, straightforwardly Protestant Book of Mormon, is through a mystical or symbolic reading where the ground is no longer the ground, it’s the symbol of God’s covenant and the promise of fruitfulness, and so on and so forth.</p>
        <p>Is this too far? Not if we believe Nephi, says DJB, who explicitly refers to the mysteries of god, which in the context of 1st temple Judaism would not be God’s unknowableness but rather mystery rites; esoteric rituals.</p>
        <p>While you could dismiss the theory when applied to one passage, it becomes hard to do it when DJB manages to successfully apply it to virtually every story, even the infamous Jacob 5.</p>
        <p>But I should mention he’s not so much finding this religion in the Book of Mormon, as he is attempting to reconstruct the religion <em>already in</em> the Book of Mormon.</p>
        <p>What this means is that this is a book that is really casting aside assumptions and asking the text to simply speak to us.</p>

        <h3 class="subheading">Consequences for Latter-day Saint Scholarship</h3>
        <p>These themes have been written about before, in “Nephi and his Asherah” and the article about the sermon at the temple by Jack Welch.</p>
        <p>These ideas need to be looked at closer by students of the scriptures and scholars, especially the fact that the divine feminine might be showing up in the Book of Mormon.</p>
        <p>But if the “course of the lord” mystery rite truly permeates the Book of Mormon to the degree this book says it does, this means that <strong>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has essentially missed Its own distinctively “Mormon” doctrines in its own book, for 200 YEARS, going all the way back to Joseph Smith</strong></p>
        <p>Don Bradley’s 116 pages book was a pioneer in pushing back on the secular idea that Joseph Smith’s theology evolved throughout his life from the 1820’s Protestant Christianity to 1840’s nauvoo Mormonism by bringing to light various remembrances of Joseph’s early lost translation pages.</p>
        <p>But DJB’s book finds this all in the book we had all along.</p>

        <h2>"The Gospel of John" - A Film about Christ</h2>
        <p>Also as part of my journey of learning this semester, I watched one of the movies about Christ that Professor Hilton recommended. I really enjoyed it, as it was a full-length movie that told the entire story of the Gospel of John in film form. One takeaway from this film is how much the Gospel of John focuses on the majesty of Christ, and how it highlights how we can feel the majesty of Christ through what is perhaps the greatest gift Christ gave to us, the Holy Ghost.</p>

        <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
        <p>I melded together some of the knowledge I learned from the film and book about Christ in this cool webpage I made where I connected Christ's words and teachings, especially in the Gospel of John, to the "course of the lord" that is the path we walk as we follow Christ and participate in making covenants with him.</p>
