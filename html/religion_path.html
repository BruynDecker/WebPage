        <h2>Following the Covenant Path</h2>
        <p>In this section, I put it all together. I talked about how Christ's doctrine, taught in the Bible and Book of Mormon, is the covenant path, and we can learn this if we listen to his teachings given in scripture. For some of the steps of the covenant path, I listed scriptures that apply to these steps. I also wrote some of the things that came to my mind this semester about how these ordanances connect us to Jesus Christ. A lot of these scriptures came to my mind while watching the Gospel of John film. </p>

                <h3 style="color:#64ffda;">Faith in Christ's Mission</h3>
                <p><strong>John 3:16</strong> – For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Repentance -->

                <h3 style="color:#64ffda;">Repentance</h3>
                <p><strong>John 3:17–21</strong></p>
                <p>17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>
                <p>18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already...</p>
                <p>19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light...</p>
                <p>20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light...</p>
                <p>21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest...</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Baptism -->
            <div class="path-step" style="background:#1e1e1e; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:5px; padding:20px; width:200px; text-align:left;">
                <h3 style="color:#64ffda;">Baptism</h3>
                <p><strong>John 3:5</strong> – Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- The Gift of the Holy Ghost -->
            <div class="path-step" style="background:#1e1e1e; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:5px; padding:20px; width:200px; text-align:left;">
                <h3 style="color:#64ffda;">The Gift of the Holy Ghost</h3>
                <p><strong>John 14:26</strong> – But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things...</p>
                <p><strong>John 20:22</strong> – And when [Jesus] had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Endowments of Power -->
            <div class="path-step" style="background:#1e1e1e; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:5px; padding:20px; width:200px; text-align:left;">
                <h3 style="color:#64ffda;">Endowments of Power</h3>
                <p><strong>Luke 24:49 (ESV)</strong> – "Behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</p>
                <p>Our endowment is to receive the power of God. When we take the endowment, it is like we are putting on Christ himself.</p>
                <p><strong>John 14:15–18</strong></p>
                <p>15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>
                <p>16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</p>
                <p>17 Even the Spirit of truth; [...] he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</p>
                <p>18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</p>
                <p>The Endowment is the gift of the Spirit given to us as we covenant to follow God's laws. In the temple endowment, we symbolically are able to receive Christ and enter into His comforting embrace. If we live the principles of the temple endowment in life, we will be able to receive Christ forever.</p>

            <!-- Sealings -->
            <div class="path-step" style="background:#1e1e1e; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:5px; padding:20px; width:200px; text-align:left;">
                <h3 style="color:#64ffda;">Sealings</h3>
                <p><strong>3 Nephi 17</strong></p>
                <p>11 And it came to pass that [Jesus] commanded that [the Nephites'] little children should be brought.</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.</p>
                <p>15 And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father...</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>21 And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</p>
                <p>22 And when he had done this he wept again;</p>
                <p>23 And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.</p>
                <p>24 And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven [...] and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.</p>
                <p>These scriptures describe Christ's ability to restore the house of Israel, which had gone astray, and to bless our children and give them to us. These promises can be fulfilled to us as we participate in temple sealings.</p>

            <!-- Marriage -->
            <div class="path-step" style="background:#1e1e1e; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:5px; padding:20px; width:200px; text-align:left;">
                <h3 style="color:#64ffda;">Marriage</h3>
                <p><strong>John 3:26–29 (NIV)</strong></p>
                <p>26 They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.”</p>
                <p>27 To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. 28 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’</p>
                <p>29 The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.</p>
            
                <p>John here explains that Jesus represents the husband, and the church represents the wife in a marriage.</p>
                <p>When we marry, it is a sacred trust from God, as "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven". Our relationship with a spouse should mirror the relationship that Christ has with all of us.</p>
